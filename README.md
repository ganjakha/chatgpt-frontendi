# chatgpt-frontend
ChatGPT frontend based on text-davinci-003 model

## Instructions to use
1. Before using one must make a file named chatgpt_config.js and store in the root directory(CWD)
2. In the file add `const apiKey = 'OPEN-AI-KEY-HERE'` to file and save. (OPEN AI Key can be got from platform.openai.com)

## Description
This frontend uses text-davinci-003 model for chat completions, which has 10x higher costs than newer models like 'gpt turbo 3.5' etc.<br>
Because of using that model, the responses of the result are more in general highly unmoderated. But, don't do any nasty things, that will eventually violate TOS of OPENAI & ChatGPT.<br>
As stated response generated will not be correct in entirety. I don't take any responsibility for that.
